## TDD 

### FizzBuzz 

FizzBuzz is a typical TDD practice exercise. Let create a function that
- should take values from  1 to 100
- should fizz when input value is a multiple of 3
- should buzz when input value is a multiple of 5
- should fizzbuzz when input value is a multiple of 3 and 5
- should display number when input value is neither multiple of 3 or 5

Tests to start
- input == 1
- input == 3
- input == 5
- input == 15
