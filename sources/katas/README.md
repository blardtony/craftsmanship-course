## TDD 

### FizzBuzz 

FizzBuzz is a typical TDD practice exercise. Let create a function that
- should take values from  1 to 100
- should fizz when input value is a multiple of 3
- should buzz when input value is a multiple of 5
- should fizzbuzz when input value is a multiple of 3 and 5
- should display number when input value is neither multiple of 3 or 5

Tests to start
- input == 1
- input == 3
- input == 5
- input == 15 

### Leap Year

Function to check if a year is a leap year. Function returns true/false
- A year it not a leap year if not divisible by 4
- A year is a leap year if divisible by 4
- A year is a leap year if divisible by 400
- A year is not a leap year if divisible by 100 but not by 400

Tests to start
- 1997 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4)
- 1996 is a leap year (divisible by 4)
- 1600 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
- 1800 is not a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, not divisible by 400)
